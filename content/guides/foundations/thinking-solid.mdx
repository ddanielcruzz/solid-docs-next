<Title> Thinking Solid </Title>

Solid's design carries several opinions on what principles and values help us best build websites and applications. It is easier to learn and use Solid when you are aware of the philosophy behind it.

And in this section we will be discussing about those specific principles. We will be discussing these principles at a high level in order for it to be understood by everyone.

## 1. Declarative Data

Declarative data or declarative programming is the process of programming in a way that describes what your program does and not how it does it. The opposite of this is imperative programming. Let's look at a quick example of these.

#### Declarative

```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let double = numbers.map((value, i) => value * 2);
```

In the piece of code above `double` is simply a copy of the values in the `numbers` array, except those values were doubled before assigning them to `double`

#### Imperative

```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let double = [];

for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  double.push(numbers[i] * 2);
}
```

The piece of code above does the same thing as the declaritve code, however, as you can see it is more complex and seems more tedious than the declaritive approach.

Solid makes use of the declarative approach to programming in a lot of aspects in order to make it simpler and quicker to adopt and understand.

## 2. Vanishing Components

It's hard enough to structure your components without taking updates into consideration. Solid updates are completely independent of the components. Component functions are called once and then cease to exist. Components exist to organize your code and not much else. Here's a quick diagram of what that process looks like

</IfDark>

## 3. Read/Write Segregation

Precise control and predictability make for better systems. We don't need true immutability to enforce unidirectional flow, just the ability to decide which consumer can or can not write or modify data. 

Solid does this in the implementation of it's primitives. Examples of these primitives are `createStore` and `createSignal` and much more.
{/* TODO: link 'more' above to the reference for primitives */}

Here's a quick example and breakdown of what we mean by Read/Write Segregation

```js
const [name, setName] = createSignal("");

const valueOfName = name(); // ðŸ‘ˆ getting

function setValueOfName(text) {
  setName(text); // ðŸ‘ˆ setting
}
```

In the above code snippet we're making use of one of Solids primitives, `createSignal`. Take note of the way getting the value of `name` is seperate from setting the value of it through the use of `setName`. This is just one of the ways Solid segregates things.

## 4. Simple Is Better Than Easy

Explicit and consistent conventions even if they require more effort are worth it. A lesson that comes hard for fine-grained reactivity. The aim is to provide minimal tools to serve as the basis to build upon. This goes back to why Solid takes a more declarative approach instead of the imperative approach.
