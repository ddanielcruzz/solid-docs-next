<Title>createContext</Title>

```ts
interface Context<T> {
  id: symbol;
  Provider: (props: { value: T; children: any }) => any;
  defaultValue: T;
}

function createContext<T>(defaultValue?: T): Context<T | undefined>;
```

Context provides a form of dependency injection in Solid. It is used to save from needing to pass data as props through intermediate components.

This function creates a new context object that can be used with [useContext](/references/api-reference/component-apis/useContext) and provides the Provider control flow. Default Context is used when no Provider is found above in the hierarchy.

```tsx
export const CounterContext = createContext([{ count: 0 }, {}]);

export function CounterProvider(props) {
  const [state, setState] = createStore({ count: props.count || 0 });
  const counter = [
    state,
    {
      increment() {
        setState("count", (c) => c + 1);
      },
      decrement() {
        setState("count", (c) => c - 1);
      },
    },
  ];

  return (
    <CounterContext.Provider value={counter}>
      {props.children}
    </CounterContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

The value passed to provider is passed to `useContext` as is. That means wrapping as a reactive expression will not work. You should pass in Signals and Stores directly instead of accessing them in the JSX.
