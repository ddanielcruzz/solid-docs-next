<Title>useContext</Title>

```ts
function useContext<T>(context: Context<T>): T;
```

Used to grab context within a context provider scope to allow for deep passing of props without having to pass them through each Component function.

```ts
const [state, { increment, decrement }] = useContext(CounterContext);
```
